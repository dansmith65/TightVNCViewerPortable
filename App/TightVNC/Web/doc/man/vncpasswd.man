.SH NAME
vncpasswd \- set passwords for VNC server
.SH SYNOPSIS

.RI [\| file \|]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBvncpasswd\fR utility should be used to create and change
passwords for the TightVNC server authentication. \fBXvnc\fR uses such
passwords when started with the \fB\-rfbauth\fR command-line option
(or when started from the \fBvncserver\fR script).

\fBvncpasswd\fR allows to enter either one or two passwords. The first
password is the primary one, the second password can be used for
view-only authentication. \fBXvnc\fR will restrict mouse and keyboard
input from clients who authenticated with the view-only password. The
\fBvncpasswd\fR utility asks interactively if it should set the second
password.

The password file name defaults to \fB$HOME/.vnc/passwd\fR unless the
\fB\-t\fR command-line option was used (see the OPTIONS section
below). The \fB$HOME/.vnc/\fR directory will be created if it does not
exist.

Each password has to be longer than five characters (unless the
\fB\-f\fR command-line option was used, see its description below). 
Only the first eight characters are significant. If the primary
password is too short, the program will abort. If the view-only
password is too short, then only the primary password will be saved.

Unless a file name was provided in the command-line explicitly, this
utility may perform certain sanity checks to prevent writing a
password file into some hazardous place.

If at least one password was saved successfully, \fBvncpasswd\fR will
exit with status code 0. Otherwise the returned status code will be
set to 1.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
Write passwords into \fB/tmp/$USER-vnc/passwd\fR, creating the
\fB/tmp/$USER-vnc/\fR directory if it does not exist, and checking the
permissions on that directory (the mode must be 700). This option can
help to improve security when your home partition may be shared via
network (e.g. when using NFS).
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Filter mode. Read plain-text passwords from stdin, write encrypted
versions to stdout. One or two passwords (full-control and view-only)
can be supplied in the input stream, newline terminates a password. 
Note that in the filter mode, short or even empty passwords will be
silently accepted.

Original VNC was developed in AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. TightVNC
additions were implemented by Constantin Kaplinsky. Many other people
participated in development, testing and support.
